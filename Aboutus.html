          Hydria Premier Water is one of the distinguished products offered by
          RUBYRUCY Group. Hydria has always been dedicated to giving back to
          both the community and the environment. The concept of providing
          essential products like bottled water stemmed from the realization

          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hydria is a naturally alkaline mineral water enriched completely by
          nature. We don’t add any minerals, Hydria is naturally filtered
          through layers of silt, clay, and rock, absorbing essential minerals
          like calcium, magnesium, sodium, silica, bicarbonates, and
          electrolytes from the earth’s crust. This natural process gives Hydria
          its alkaline properties. We've also included video clips of our farm
          (the source of Hydria) on our website, so you can enjoy a glimpse of
          the beautiful natural surroundings.
        </p>
